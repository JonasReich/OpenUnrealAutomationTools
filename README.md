# Open Unreal Automation Tools

![](./Resources/oua_wide.png)

The Open Unreal Automation Tools are lightweight scripts for automating UE4 processes like builds, automation tests, etc.

## Language

The tools in this repository are a mix of powershell, batch and python scripts.
I'm still in a process of determining what works best for my purposes.

## Development

The tools are developed alongside with the [Open Unreal Utiltiies plugin](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities).

At this point of time, this project is not ready for contributions, but I'm planning to enable pull requests eventually.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE.md).
