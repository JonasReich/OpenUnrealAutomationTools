![](./Resources/oua_wide.png)

The Open Unreal Automation Tools are lightweight scripts for automating UE4 processes like builds, automation tests, etc.

## Development

The tools are developed alongside with the [Open Unreal Utiltiies plugin](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities).

At this point of time, this project is not ready for contributions, but I'm planning to enable pull requests eventually.
